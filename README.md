2. Form Manipulation with JavaScript
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to practice manipulating HTML forms dynamically using JavaScript, with a focus on handling arrays, objects, and form elements to capture user input and modify form behavior.
Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a web page containing a form that allows users to input their information. The page should utilize JavaScript to dynamically handle form submissions, store input data in arrays and objects, and modify form behavior based on user interaction.
Task 1: Create an HTML form with input fields for the user's name, email, and message.
Task 2: Write JavaScript code to handle form submissions and store user input in an object.
Task 3: Implement form validation to ensure that all required fields are filled before submission.

3. Styling with JavaScript
Objective: The objective of this assignment is to practice manipulating CSS styles dynamically using JavaScript. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to apply various styling changes to HTML elements based on user interaction or other events.
Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a web page that demonstrates dynamic styling using JavaScript. The page should include HTML elements that change their appearance in response to user actions or events triggered by JavaScript functions.
Task 1: Create an HTML structure with at least 5 elements that will be styled dynamically.
<="" code="" style="margin: 0px 0px 30px; padding: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; position: relative; display: block; min-height: 40px; width: 582.799px;">
<div id="box" onclick="changeColor()">Click me to change color</div>
Task 2: Write JavaScript code to dynamically change the color of the box element when clicked.
Task 3: Implement additional styling changes based on user interaction, such as mouse hover effects or button clicks on different HTML elements.
